<h1> The best key lime pie recipe</h1> 

<P>Ive liked Key lime pie for a while now, so much so that I look up recipes for the desert so I can make the desert on my own. Key lime pie is a desert that i feel anyone <br> can like and, can make multiple servings of if needed to. This recipe is from <a href="https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/key-lime-pie-recipe1-2011840">FoodNetwork</a> as ive used the recipe for so long i feel the recipe should be shared with others, <br> especially for those who like key lime pie. </P>

<p> Graham Cracker Crust:<br><ul>
<li>1/3 of a 1-pound box graham crackers</li> <br>
<li>5 tablespoons melted unsalted butter</li><br>
<li>1/3 cup sugar</li></ul>

<p>Filling:

<br> <li>3 egg yolks <br> <li>2 teaspoons lime zest</li></li><br />
<li>1(14-ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>  
<br><li>2/3 cup freshly squeezed Key lime juice, or store bought</li><p/>

<p>Topping:
<br><li>1 cup heavy or whipping cream chilled </li><br />
<li>2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar</li><p/>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p><ol><li> For the graham cracker crust: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees</li></p>
<p><li> Break up the graham crackers; place in a food processor and process to crumbs. If you don't have a food processor, place the crackers <br> in a large plastic bag; seal and then crush the crackers with a rolling pin. Add the melted butter and sugar and pulse or stir until combined. <br>Press the mixture into the bottom and side of a pie pan, forming a neat border around the edge. Bake the crust until set and golden, 8 minutes. Set aside on a wire rack; leave the oven on.</li>

<p><li>For the filling: Meanwhile, in an electric mixer with the wire whisk attachment, beat the egg yolks and <br>lime zest at high speed until very fluffy, about 5 minutes. Gradually add the condensed milk and continue to beat until thick, <br> 3 or 4 minutes longer. Lower the mixer speed and slowly add the lime juice, mixing just until combined, no longer. <br>Pour the mixture into the crust. Bake for 10 minutes, or until the filling has just set. Cool on a wire rack, then refrigerate. Freeze for 15 to 20 minutes before serving.</li></p>
<p><li>For the topping: Whip the cream and the confectioners' sugar until nearly stiff. <br>Cut the pie into wedges and serve very cold, topping each wedge with a large dollop of whipped cream.</li></p>

<strong>Serve a Maximum of 3 slices per person </strong>
