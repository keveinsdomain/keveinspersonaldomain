<h2><strong>Hobbies</strong></h2> <p> For hobbies i really enjoy relaxing by gardening, which i've gotten into recently or by watching or playing sports such as , basketball <br /> soccer, football. One of my favorite hobbies I have enjoyed to do since being a little kid is, reading or collection comics and manga <br /> and, watching anime.Even though i sold many of my collections i still have a reletively big collection of <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Manga+are+comics+or+graphic+novels+originating+from+Japan&lr=lang_en&rlz=1CAEVJI_enUS962US962&biw=1536&bih=738&tbs=lr%3Alang_1en&sxsrf=AOaemvJ5JmjOgkdlSAyleYgxnMaM6q-uQg%3A1634363787053&ei=i2lqYbLVAuCtqtsPgrSeyAM&ved=0ahUKEwjyxtfHn87zAhXglmoFHQKaBzkQ4dUDCA4&oq=Manga+are+comics+or+graphic+novels+originating+from+Japan&gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAwyBQghEKABMgUIIRCrAjoHCAAQRxCwAzoHCCMQ6gIQJ0oECEEYAFDTfViZlwFg16YBaARwAngAgAGFAogBhQKSAQMyLTGYAQCgAQGgAQKwAQrIAQjAAQE&sclient=gws-wiz">manga</a> and comics.
